Sure, here's an example of a simple PHP code snippet:

```php
<?php
// Define a variable
$name = "John Doe";

// Print a message using the variable
echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";

// Perform a calculation
$number1 = 10;
$number2 = 5;
$sum = $number1 + $number2;

// Print the result
echo "The sum of " . $number1 . " and " . $number2 . " is " . $sum . ".";
?>
```

This code snippet demonstrates basic PHP syntax. It defines a variable `$name` and prints a message using that variable. It also performs a calculation by adding two numbers (`$number1` and `$number2`) and then prints the result.
